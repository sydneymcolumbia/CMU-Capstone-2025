The client's current YOLOv10-based firearm detection system struggles with efficiency and reliability in real-time CCTV footage.
• Slow processing speed, reduced accuracy in  low-quality images, and lack of explainability in detection decisions.
• High false positives resulting in large amount of images being sent to the cloud, causing high computer storage cost and a waste of resource
• A more efficient and accurate detection model is needed, with automated logging for performance tracking
